## What I did
- Installed and tested pre-release builds via TestFlight on iOS devices.  
- Performed exploratory testing across core flows: onboarding, account setup, creating and editing posts, uploading images/videos, feed interactions (like/reply/share), and profile settings.  
- Reported issues with clear reproduction steps, attached screenshots/screenshots and videos where applicable, and submitted feedback through TestFlight.  
- Verified app behaviour after updates and confirmed fixes when new builds were released.  
- Observed and collected crash reports and device logs when applicable.

## Example contributions

- Provided UI/UX feedback on onboarding flow (suggestions for clearer CTAs).  
- Noted occasional crashes and provided device logs via TestFlight feedback.
